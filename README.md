learnRails
==========

I am in the process of learning Ruby on Rails, so this repository is where I am putting my test project as I familiarize myself with Rails.

This repository contains what I’ve worked on so far in Rails.
I’m using bootstrap to style all of the rails forms and pages, but I am
still in the process of doing that. This project is just a basic blog
application that I am building as I go through the Rails tutorial.
